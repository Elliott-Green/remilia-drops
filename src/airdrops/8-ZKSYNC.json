		"description": "zkSync is a Layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that employs zk-rollup technology to enhance scalability and efficiency. By bundling multiple transactions into a single cryptographic proof and processing them off-chain, zkSync significantly boosts Ethereumâ€™s transaction throughput.  Notably, this approach helps alleviate network congestion and lowers gas fees, making it more cost-effective for users to interact with Ethereum smart contracts and send tokens. Despite its off-chain processing, zkSync maintains a high level of security by anchoring transaction finality to the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring the safety of user assets.",
